# Javascript_Quiz

This program is a javascript fundamental quiz where the user has 90 secs to solve five questions. When the user gets a question correct, they will receive 20 points. When they are incorrect, it will be a deduction of 15 seconds from the timer. Once all the problems are solved, or the timer has completed, the quiz terminates. The user will then put in their name's initial to save their score on local storage. There will be a scoreboard to display all student's scores on the test for comparison. The user can clear out the scoreboard or retake the quiz. This website is responsive so the user can study the exam on any digital device without losing features.
